# CVE Bot - Automatic CVE Posting to Bluesky

A minimal, production-ready Python bot that automatically monitors for new CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) from multiple sources and posts them to Bluesky social media platform.

## Features

- **Multiple CVE Sources**: Monitors NVD, CISA, and GitHub Security Advisories
- **Automatic Posting**: Posts new CVEs to Bluesky with formatted content
- **Severity-based Sorting**: Prioritizes high and critical vulnerabilities
- **Scheduled Operation**: Can run continuously or on-demand
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API limits and adds delays between posts
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logs for monitoring and debugging
- **Minimal Footprint**: Clean, production-ready codebase

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Bluesky account (https://bsky.app)
- App password for Bluesky (not your main password)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Copy `env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your configuration:
   ```bash
   # Bluesky Configuration
   BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER=your-username.bsky.social
   BLUESKY_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   
   # CVE Sources (comma-separated)
   CVE_SOURCES=nvd,cisa,github
   
   # NVD API Configuration
   NVD_API_KEY=your-nvd-api-key-optional
   NVD_RESULTS_PER_PAGE=2000
   NVD_MAX_DAYS_BACK=7
   
   # NVD Filtering Options
   NVD_SEVERITY_FILTER=CRITICAL,HIGH
   NVD_INCLUDE_KEV=true
   NVD_INCLUDE_CERT_ALERTS=false
   NVD_INCLUDE_CERT_NOTES=false
   
   # Posting Configuration
   POST_INTERVAL_MINUTES=30
   MAX_POSTS_PER_RUN=5
   ```

### Getting Bluesky App Password

1. Go to https://bsky.app
2. Sign in to your account
3. Go to Settings â†’ App Passwords
4. Generate a new app password
5. Use this password in your `.env` file

### Getting NVD API Key (Optional)

**The bot works perfectly without an NVD API key!** However, getting one provides higher rate limits:

1. **Go to:** https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key
2. **Fill out the form** with your email and intended use
3. **Wait 1-2 business days** for approval (usually automatic)
4. **Add to your `.env` file** for 10x higher rate limits

**Rate Limits:**
- **Without API key:** 5 requests per 6 seconds
- **With API key:** 50 requests per 6 seconds

**Note:** This is completely optional and free. The bot will work fine without it.

## Usage

### Run Once
```bash
python3 cve_bot.py
# Choose option 1 when prompted
```

### Run Scheduled
```bash
python3 cve_bot.py
# Choose option 2 when prompted
```

### Clear Processed CVEs and Run
```bash
python3 cve_bot.py
# Choose option 3 when prompted
```

The bot automatically tests connections before running.

## CVE Sources

### NVD (National Vulnerability Database)

## Post Format

Posts include:
- CVE ID and severity level
- Description (smartly truncated to fit Bluesky's 300-character limit)
- CVSS score (if available)
- Exploitation status (if known)
- Source and publication date
- Relevant hashtags

Example post:
```

## Logging

The bot creates detailed logs in `cve_bot.log` and also displays them in the console. Logs include:
- CVE discovery and processing
- Bluesky posting attempts and results
- Error messages and debugging information
- Connection test results

## Error Handling

The bot includes comprehensive error handling:
- Automatic re-authentication on Bluesky errors
- Graceful handling of API failures
- Retry logic for transient errors
- Detailed error logging
- Individual source failure isolation

## Security Considerations

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Use app passwords, not your main Bluesky password
- The bot only reads CVE data and posts to your account
- No sensitive data is stored or transmitted

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors
- Verify your Bluesky credentials
- Ensure you're using an app password, not your main password
- Check if your account has any restrictions

### NVD API Issues
- **Without API key:** Bot will work but may be slower due to rate limits
- **Rate limiting errors:** Increase delays between requests or get an API key
- **API key not working:** Verify the key is correctly copied to `.env` file
- **No CVEs found:** Check if your severity filters are too restrictive

### No CVEs Found
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the CVE sources are accessible
- Check the logs for specific error messages
- Use option 3 to clear processed CVEs and re-run

### Rate Limiting
- Increase delays between posts
- Get an NVD API key for higher limits
- Reduce posting frequency
